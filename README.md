# form-validation-and-cookie-setup | Log in with cookie set up

This challenge is to create a password protected page with a login window. Name-password combinations will be checked. A cookie is set if the login is successful.

Storing passwords publicly and unencrypted in JavaScript variables is not a common practice. This is just a simplified example of authentication!

## Overview

### The challenge

Create a login form in a modal:

- if you enter a valid name-password combination, the content behind it becomes visible
- the password is case-sensitive, the username is not
- the name of the currently logged in user is displayed on the page
- a cookie is set if the login is successful
- ff the cookie is set, the user should not have to log in again
- clicking on the “Logout” button removes the cookie and the page closes
